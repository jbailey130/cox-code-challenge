# Calendar

Pull project down or clone.
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
To start project run `npm run build`.
Server runs on port 3000.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

## API

There is a mock API call to an apiary.io end point. This was to show retrieving data from an external source instead of loading it from a local file or hard coding it.

## Other things
Given more time I would have like to add more validation to the inputs and style the calendar a bit more. Also, I would have liked to add a description input to give the reservation some context.
